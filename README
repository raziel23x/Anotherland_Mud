This is a Very old MUD that various people wrote over the years called Another Land.
Was ran for quite a while on MudMagic till the owner and person who kept it up put it to rest.
Was kept up and alive till it was shutdown by Marisella(Kristine Kraft, Recently passed away also).
It is written in C and there is some minor changes to it from time to time it is a self contained 
world classes and many other interesting features and options to both the players as well as the staff.
